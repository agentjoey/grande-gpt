# pact protocol

This repo uses the **pact protocol** (v1). Seats (who does what) are listed in
`.pact/PROJECT.md` and `.pact/STATE.yml`.

**Your identity — bind it to this working copy first.** Your seat is resolved
from `PACT_AGENT_ID` (env), else the untracked `.pact/seat` file. Set the
file once per working copy:
```bash
pactify seat use <your-seat-id>   # from the roster in .pact/PROJECT.md
```
For concurrent seats in the same repo, use a separate git worktree per seat.

**Primary — MCP:** the `pact` MCP server is wired into your config. Use its tools
(projects / status / join / assign / checkpoint / accept / changes / merge / validate) and
resources (`pact://state`, `pact://log`). Cold start: call `status`, then `join`
(registers your seat and checks out your feature branch). Every action tool takes an
optional `project` (a name from `projects`) to act on another registered repo without
restarting — default is this repo.

**Fallback — shell** (if MCP is unavailable):
```bash
pactify seat use <your-seat-id>   # if not already bound
pactify join --roles <your-roles>
```
then `pactify help` for the verbs.

**The two rules:** a worker cannot self-accept (only the task's reviewer accepts); a
feature cannot merge until all its tasks are accepted.
